<p>We talk so much about investing on this podcast and the different ways to do it. So before we get going, I want to let you know that this episode is brought to you by my friends at 10 East. 10 East is an investing platform for sophisticated investors to access private markets. It brings the benefits of having your own family office without the cost and the headaches of doing so. 10 East is founded and led by Michael LaFell, former deputy executive managing member at Davidson Kempner. Tenney’s core strategy is to apply institutional grade due diligence to more niche exposures across private markets in equity and credit and real estate. The principals and partners at 10 East invested their own money in these deals to align interests to learn more. Please check out 10 east.co. That’s the number 10 east.co.</p>

<p>What I want to talk about today might seem like it only applies to very successful people, very rich and famous people or very rich and famous companies.</p>

<p>What I want you to keep in mind when you’re listening to this is that the topic of today might apply the most to very rich and successful people famous people, but it definitely applies to ordinary people as well. And even if you think the topic of cyclicality does not apply to your career and your life, it definitely applies to the economy that you live in and work in.</p>

<p>So this topic, the idea that everything is cyclical, I think really applies to everybody.</p>

<p>A few years ago, French geologists discovered that a Himalayan mountain suffered a massive landslide 800 years ago.</p>

<p>Now massive here might be an understatement because the slide that they discover moved enough earth to bury Manhattan as high as the Empire State building.</p>

<p>The mountain is called on a pruna for and it used to be 800 years ago, one of the top five tallest mountains in the world. But today, after the slide that they’ve now discovered, shaved a third of a mile off the top of the mountain. It is merely just a big, almost unmentionable mountain.</p>

<p>Now, here’s what’s interesting. The amazing thing is that this slide that they discovered was not caused by a glacier gnawing away at the mountain, which is usually what keeps mountain height in check. But on a prune for the reason, it had this massive collapse and slide was that it just got too big as anyone who has built a sandcastle knows there comes a point when the whole thing just comes crashing down on its own accord, crushed by the weight of its own vertical greed. And that’s what happened here, everything in life is cyclical. And the thing that is so easy to miss about cyclicality is that it doesn’t require an outside force to push it in the other direction.</p>

<p>The mere act of getting big is enough to make you smaller without being pushed around by anyone or anything from the outside.</p>

<p>So many mistakes in life come when you think of that risk is something that is only caused by an external force. When in fact, the weight of your own success is enough to pull you down without any outside help.</p>

<p>This applies to so many things in life. You can find examples of this happening everywhere in his 1944 book. Why don’t we learn from history? Bh Liddell Hart writes about why after every major war in history, the people involved in that war say that was so awful. We will never do that again. Only of course to find themselves back on the battlefield a few years or maybe a few decades later. And Hart writes, quote, we learn from history that complete victory has never been completed by the result that the victors always anticipate a good and lasting peace for victory has always sown the seeds of a fresh war because victory breeds among the vanquished, a desire for vindication and vengeance and because victory raises fresh rivals.</p>

<p>So that was a lot to take in. Let me repeat one of these lines here that you just said victory has always sown the seeds of a fresh war. That is such a strange concept, but it’s so obviously true in his book, Evil Roy Baumeister writes, quote, the First World War had always been so much more horrible than anything Europeans had ever remembered or imagined that it produced a lasting and profound psychological impact. The winners concluded that there must be no more wars. The losers concluded that there had to be another war to set things, right? So much sacrifice could not be allowed to be in vain. So it’s like you go through this thing like the first World War and everyone says, look, we can’t do that again. It was so awful. But actually the people who lost that war were like, no, we have to do it again to have a rematch to set it straight, right? So it was like the bigger the war, the more sacrifice there was the higher, the odd that there was going to be another one. So World War One led to World War Two which led to the Cold War, which led to Russia invading Ukraine on and on forever. It’s this endless chain and the stakes are obviously much lower. But I think a similar thing happens in companies and economies where the bigger and more successful you become, the harder it is to maintain your success over time.</p>

<p>So what were the big winning companies of the last century? Well, it was General Motors General Electric IBM Nokia Citigroup, Kodak. It, it is not hard to come up with a list of previous giants that crumpled under their own weight and either don’t exist or are shells of their former cells now.</p>

<p>And for each, it is fair to say that past success directly led to future failure because of their sense of entitlement because of jealousy among other competitors, because of bureaucratic bloat that they accumulated over time.</p>

<p>So I’ll keep that in mind and think about this bit that I’m about to read you from an article that came out last year about today’s untouchable winning dominant giant Amazon. The article reads quote at Amazon. It is always supposed to be day one, the dawn of a new era where the customer comes first and bold bets are backed. Not surprisingly, that’s gotten harder to maintain now that it’s a tech and retail. Goliath employees have complained about red tape bloat and bureaucracy facing a new financial reality. CEO Andy Jasse is exercising discipline when it comes to Amazon’s bets the company is facing intense external pressure. It is tough to be a trillion dollar revolutionary. Now, look, Amazon is, I think will continue to be for some time, an absolutely incredible company. But it’s true. If you are a student of history, how many of these companies struggle under the weight of their own success? Literally, the fact that they are big and successful is the force that will drive them down.</p>

<p>What is the lesson there as a big successful company? Is it be careful what you wish for? Make sure you always stay on your toes. Watch behind your back. Uh Yes, of course, those are good lessons. But the biggest lesson is simply that everything in life is cyclical, calm times, plant the seeds of crazy times, bad times, growth plants, the seeds of decline, success plants, the seeds of loss, everything is cyclical.</p>

<p>And so we just talked about the national level with wars. We talked about the company level with individual companies. But of course, all of this applies at the individual level to people like you and me.</p>

<p>Robert Green. The great author writes quote, never be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by flaunting the qualities that raise you above others by making others aware of their inferior position. You are only stirring up unhappy admiration or envy. There is nothing more intoxicating than victory and nothing more dangerous. So of course, he’s saying if if you are going out on social media and saying, look how great I am. Look how successful I am. Look how beautiful my family is. You think people are admiring that but very often there, you’re just storing up envy, you’re just signaling to other people that maybe your life is better to them, that you’re happier than them is actually doing you any good. And so when that success or that wonderful family is genuine. Does that actually cause people to look at you in a bad way and therefore your success becomes cyclical and it’s gonna draw you down when others become envious of you.</p>

<p>It’s such a tricky thing that the more successful you become, the easier it is for people to resent you for your success. And even when somebody says, oh, I’m, I’m so happy for you and they’re genuine about it, your success or may maybe it’s uh a, a work promotion or a raise you just got puts their own career into sharper context, inflating their expectations and potentially leaving them feeling worse off about themselves. So much of whether people like you or not is just how you make them feel about themselves when you interact with them. And if you’re constantly talking about how successful you are, you’re doing the opposite, you’re making them feel worse about themselves. And that dwindling support can come back to bite when those who were used to be eager to help you at one point are now less enthusiastic to help you in the future because they are envious of you. The rapper Drake put this so well. He said, quote, people like you more when you are working towards something, not when you have it.</p>

<p>Then of course, there’s the connection between money and ambition.</p>

<p>William Vanderbilt once said that having a lot of money is as a death to ambition as cocaine is to morality like the more money you have, the less ambitious you become not true for everybody, but it’s true for a lot of people, happiness can be another cyclical thing. Uh I love this detail that I’m about to read from the Tire King Harvey Firestone. This is in his biography written about 100 years ago. He was wondering about the simple life that he had before becoming rich and famous and he wrote quote sometimes it seems that it might be better to go back to those simpler days that one might get more out of a less complex life, but it cannot be done. One changes with prosperity. We all think we would like to lead a simple life and that we find that we have picked up 1000 little habits which we are quite unconscious of because they’re part of our very being and these habits are not in the simple life. There is no going back except as a broken man.</p>

<p>Oh, what a line, that last one is, there is no going back to the simple life except as a broken man. So he’s saying, look now that when he was rich and famous, he would daydream nostalgically about what it was like to have a simple life in a simple little cottage with his family. But there is no going back to that simple life except as a broken man. So the success, the money, the fame that he had at one point in his in his life. It, it may have been making him less happy than he was when he was living a, a very simple life. And so maybe that’s the cycle that ordinary people go through. You start with a dream and then you accomplish that dream. And then what was previously considered a dream becomes a new baseline of reality. And then the gaze of your ambition moves to the next dream.</p>

<p>It goes from inadequacy to hard work to elation, back to inadequacy, to hard work, to elation. Everything is cyclical to some extent. I think these cycles are inescapable. It’s just part of how the world works. That’s especially true for the economy and the stock market and other social trends. So much of long term success relies on accepting and preparing for cyclicality versus assuming that it can be prevented at the individual level. Though I think Skua can be managed around the edges a little bit.</p>

<p>My friend, Shane Parrish once described the difference between passive and active stability, who said Iraq is passively stable, it’ll keep its current form without any intervention. Marriage. On the other hand, is not passively stable, it can be stable over time, but it requires constant work and compromise and maintenance to keep it intact.</p>

<p>Most things in your life are at best actively stable, left alone, they will follow nature’s natural path of cyclicality.</p>

<p>But if there’s constant intervention and management, managing your expectations, managing your reputation, managing how you advertise yourself and who you surround yourself with. Then you have at least a shot of keeping something good going for the longest period of time.</p>

<p>Thats it for this week. Thanks again for listening and we’ll see you next time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We talk so much about investing on this podcast and the different ways to do it.

<p>All right, we’re back. I had to take a couple of weeks off. Like many of you. I got sick from what my kids brought home from school and I lost my voice. Sounded like death for a couple of weeks. Sounded like I was trying to swallow a chainsaw. But we’re back. Thanks for being patient.</p>

<p>My wife recently bought this book from an old bookstore. It’s called The Mathematical Theory of Investment. It was written in 1913, which is why she bought it. It’s this beautiful old leather bound weathered book and she thought I’d be interested in it and I love it. It looks great on my bookshelf this old ancient book sitting there. It looks great, but it’s so funny. It’s so funny to flip through it that this book written in 1913 called The Mathematical Theory of Investment is as dry and boring as it sounds. It’s just a bunch of formulas about how compound interest works, written in the driest academic prose. You could possibly imagine and look when I think about things like that, like the analytical mathematical, deep academic side of finance. Do I think it is wrong or unnecessary No, I think we know a lot today that we did not even 100 years ago when this book was written that we are better off for, but it’s just so true that what actually matters in people’s lives in terms of using money as a tool to live a better life and be happier in what actually works are things that are not found at all in a book like this. The source of what matters with money is not the formulas. It’s not the education, it’s not the academics, it’s just the behavior, it’s just the understanding in your own head about what your goals are. What your temperament is, how risk worked. That’s what actually matters. So I have been jotting these things down for a while. I just wanted to share with you what I think are the 10 most important rules that exist in money that anyone should be able to understand and wrap their heads around that are both a understandable which everything in this book I’m holding is not and b are not analytical at all. They are just behavioral in nature. So look, this is just my list. Your results may vary. Your opinions on money may vary. But if I had to make a list of the 10 most important financial traits for anyone to grasp and think about in their own lives, here’s what they would be.</p>

<p>Number one, realize that it can happen to you job loss, divorce a string of disastrous investments succumbing to your emotional flaws, being a victim of fraud, getting hit by a wrist that you didn’t see coming to people in good financial shape. These things tend to be viewed as something that happens to quote other people, but they can happen to you. They can happen to me. They will happen to everyone listening to this in some given period of time. So given enough time, one of those things will happen to you. Some people are of course more susceptible than others, but nobody is exempt in life from being humbled on occasion. That should make you think about room for error and risk in a deeper and more profound way than you normally would if things are going well for you in your life. Look, if you can just survive and endure long enough financially to stick around for the longest period of time, you do not need to make many great decisions in life to do well financially, you just need to avoid catastrophe and realizing that it can happen to you. The bad news, the bad luck that you see happening to other people can happen to you is the first acknowledgment. The first skill that you need in order to have the appropriate room for error to do well over time.</p>

<p>Alright, number two realize that no one is as impressed with your possessions as much as you are. No one’s thinking about you as much as you are. Nobody cares about your stuff as much as you do. It’s so easy to overestimate the social signaling benefit of having nice stuff. But the quirk is that people who see your nice stuff spend more time imagining themselves with your stuff than they do actually admire you for having that nice stuff.</p>

<p>So look, I like, I like nice stuff. I like nice homes. I like nice cars, all of it, but I try to only want it when it’s comfortable and convenient and or efficient or delicious rather than fooling myself into imagining that it will bring some level of higher status and importance.</p>

<p>Alright. Number three, accepting that living below your means requires suppressing your ego to below your income.</p>

<p>Spending money above some certain level of basic needs and basic leisure oftentimes is just ego and social climbing. That’s why you’re doing it, you’re doing it to show other people how much money you have. So in that equation, then savings is just a diversion from boosting the appearance of your status today for more productive use tomorrow. And when you define savings as the gap between your ego and your income, you realize why many people with decent incomes save so little. It’s a daily struggle against the natural instincts to extend your peacock feathers to their outermost limits people with enduring personal finance success, which is not necessarily those with the highest incomes tend to have a propensity to not give a damn, what others think about them. They’re concerned with their own happiness, their own individual family, maybe a couple of people around them, close friends who they want to love and admire them, but their ability, their willingness, their need and desire to show off to strangers is minimal.</p>

<p>I saw this podcast recently and the guest on it was Steve O which if you remember to the early two thousands show on MTV called Jackass. He’s one of the characters in there who his role on the show, Jackass was doing the most inane things to put himself through crazy amounts of pain and get beat up and to take crazy risks. And they asked him on the podcast, they said, do you just have like an above average tolerance for pain? And he said, no, not whatsoever. He said my desire for attention has always exceeded my need for comfort. And like that’s, that’s a profound statement in itself. But I, I mean, we’re thinking that that applies to a lot of things, your desire for attention from other people exceeds what you actually need to be happy in your own life. If you could just avoid that, that’s an incredible financial power.</p>

<p>Alright. Number four, a spouse who sees eye to eye on spending.</p>

<p>This is a really important one and it’s one that a lot of people do not want to address the fastest way to break your finances is to marry somebody with wildly different spending expectations. It’s not only gonna break your finances, it’s gonna break your marriage as well. By the way, two people who spend a lot is probably safer in a relationship than having one saver and one super spender since money disputes are the leading cause of divorce. It’s not even spending too much. It’s just disagreeing on how much you should spend.</p>

<p>By the way, a related personal finance hack from my friend James Osborne. He says the number one financial hack for most people to follow, don’t get divorced.</p>

<p>All right. Number five, avoiding trouble to begin with. Charlie Munger. Rest of soul passed away recently. He says, quote, nobody survives open heart surgery better than the guy who did not need the procedure in the first place. That is, that is so good, so true. And a corollary to that is that nobody gets out of debt faster than the person who avoided it to begin with. Count how many programs there are to consolidate and manage student loans compared with those encouraging strategies to get a degree without any debt to begin with. It’s 100 to 1 at least it’s the same in investing. Part of why get rich quick schemes are popular is because so many people need to get rich quick after delaying their savings for too long and they can’t retire.</p>

<p>An underappreciated truth in finance, especially in investing is that you don’t need to make many great decisions to do. Well, over time, you just have to consistently not blow it and not screw up for a very long period of time.</p>

<p>All right. Number six, maybe my favorite one here, a very finely tuned bullshit radar that screams red alert when promise of abnormal gains without abnormal sacrifice are offered to you any time that somebody is promising you something to gain a reward faster or in bigger amounts. Without any other cost of admission that that you have to put in is almost certainly always pulling your leg and they are so pervasive in finance because the opportunity for them to make so much money from so many gullible people is enormous.</p>

<p>All right. Number seven, picking a career that may not be your passion but pays a decent wage.</p>

<p>Chris Rock, the comedian has this advice that I loved. He says, stop telling kids that they can be anything they want when they grow up. He says you could be anything you were good at. As long as they’re hiring. I think that’s it like a lot of comedy. It’s funny because it’s true, Scott Galloway. He has related advice. He says people who tell you to follow your passion are already rich. They made their money in iron ore smelting. Most likely, that’s also great advice. This of course, is unpopular to say, but a career that isn’t your passion yet earns a good income can actually be preferable to the alternative. And this is less about money and it’s more about freedom and independence, a low income job that is your passion, may breed resentment as you age and have kids and get a mortgage and have higher bills that become burdens long enough that suffocate the joy that you get from working in a career that is your passion, but a job that you merely like that pays a decent income provided that you live below your means and save a chunk of that income can eventually offer a level of financial flexibility that lets you pursue passions as hobbies purely for their pleasure.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos has this other related advice that I think is very strong. He says, if you can get to a point in your career where you enjoy half of it, that’s great. That’s like the picture of success when you can enjoy half of your career, which means the other half is gonna feel like work. And his point was that’s good that, that, that’s, that’s about as best that you can get. So pick something that you can enjoy and, and earn a good living from. Even if it’s not the thing that is feeding your soul. I think it can actually be preferable to living a long term healthy life than just following the advice of follow your passion.</p>

<p>Number eight, the willingness to adapt views that you wish were permanent, all economies grow because businesses and consumers and technologies change and adapt. And it’s ironic how many investors attempt to ride this wave of change with rigid beliefs. Now, of course, there are a set of truly timeless investing ideas, timeless investing philosophies.</p>

<p>But most of what guides us are beliefs that reflect what we’ve happened to experience. And the narrow view of our own lives.</p>

<p>Even when investors study history, they put more weight on stories that align with their own experiences because those are stories that are easier to understand and they confirm their own beliefs.</p>

<p>It’s painful to contemplate. But a lot of what all of us believe about investing is either right but temporary or wrong but convincing.</p>

<p>And if you are unwilling to update, if you’re unwilling to update your views when the world changes or be open minded enough to realize that some of your views were anecdotal to begin with. That’s gonna be tough to succeed in this field.</p>

<p>Number nine, this actually might be one of the most important of the list. The ability to be comfortable being uncomfortable, you cannot enjoy the benefits of exercise without some sort of discomfort because being out of breath and sore and tired is the sign that you’ve put in enough effort to deserve a reward.</p>

<p>It’s the same in investing the financial rewards for being comfortable as an investor are the same as the physical rewards for somebody who sits on the couch returns do not come for free. They demand a price and they accept payment for that price. Not in dollars. That’s not how you pay it. You pay for it with uncertainty and confusion and short term loss and surprise and nonsense and stretches of boredom, regret, anxiety, fear. That’s how you pay the bill. Most markets are efficient enough to not offer any coupons either you have to pay the bill in full.</p>

<p>There are four psychological states of investing in order of a lucrativeness. The first is miserable but confident in its eventual rewards. The second is miserable and giving up. The third is comfortable in accepting of its future downside and the worst is comfortable and oblivious of what is to come. Thats the complete list.</p>

<p>Alright. Last number 10, the ability to distinguish when analytics versus psychology is necessary.</p>

<p>If investing were only about numbers like the book that my wife got me recently is nobody would be any good at it because computers would arbitrage away all the opportunity. And if it were only about psychology, nobody would be any good at it because every investor has different arbitrary goals and markets would never coalesce around something objective. Good investing is some part analytical and some part psychological. It’s an art and a science. The trick is knowing which skill is necessary when it’s necessary and how one affects the other.</p>

<p>That’s all we got for this week. By the way, if you want to hear another podcast with my good friend Doug Bonaparte and I talking about what we learned from Charlie Munger after he passed away recently, go check out our podcast with public.com. It’s called Mind Your Money. I’ll leave a link in the show notes.</p>

<p>Thanks again. We’ll see you all next week.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
